apt-get install apache2

#checked that localhost on the website doesn't work. 
#Checked firewall rules:
apt-get install ufw
ufw app list

#checked www (opens only 80 port for unfiltered web traffic). Since 
#we do not have SSL configured, i allowed this. 
ufw allow www

#check apache2 status
systemctl status apache2
#and then entered the IP address in the website and voila! Got the Apache screen.

#Created 3 domains under /var/www
mkdir -p {dundermifflin.com, michaescottpapercompany.com, schrutefarms.com}

#Changed permissioning to world readable and executable for the above 3 domains
chmod 770 {the company names}

#created an index.html basic website and stored it in dundermifflin.com
#created a dundermifflin.com.conf file and added config
vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/dundermifflin.com.conf

#to propogate changes and enable the website
a2ensite dundermifflin.com.conf
a2dissite 000-default.conf
apache2ctl configtest

#it showed that the global config wasn't set with the server name error.

echo "ServerName 127.0.0.1" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

#checked if the config is ok now
apache2ctl configtest

#For RedHat Apache Installation
yum install httpd

#Start the Apache process manually
systemctl start httpd

#Verify the status
systemctl status httpd

#If the service is active, you're good.
#Open 100.64.26.4 on your browser. Voila! Got the default apache web page.

#rsync-ed all files from C to D to /var/www/html
rsync -avz --delete root@100.64.26.3:"/var/www/html" /var/www/
#The reason why it is /var/www is because the entire directory html would get copied to /var/www/html/html. That's not what we want.
